/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `profile` on the `users` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[userId]` on the table `profiles` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Changed the type of `authorId` on the `posts` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `profiles` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
